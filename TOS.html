    <h2>2. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Bot is intended for personal use within Discord servers and should not be used in a manner that violates Discord’s <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" style="color: #8e44ad;">Terms of Service</a> or any applicable laws.</li>

    <h2>3. Music and Content Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>By using the Bot, you acknowledge that the Bot only facilitates access to music and does not host or store music files. The Bot may stream content from third-party services (e.g., YouTube, SoundCloud) according to those platforms' terms and limitations.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to play any music or content in your Discord server and for any legal implications that may arise.</li>
