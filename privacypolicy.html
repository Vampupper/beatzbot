    <h1>Privacy Policy for Beatzbot Discord Music Bot</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 14, 2024</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Beatzbot (“the Bot”) collects, uses, and protects user information when used within a Discord server. By using the Bot, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Server IDs and Channel IDs:</strong> Collected to identify the servers where the Bot is used and to manage its functionality in specific channels.</li>
        <li><strong>User Commands:</strong> Beatzbot may log user commands to improve its functionality and user experience. These logs are temporary and not stored long-term.</li>
        <li><strong>Music Requests:</strong> The Bot may temporarily store song requests or playlist information to queue and play music within a server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The information collected is used solely to operate and improve Beatzbot’s services. This includes managing music requests, maintaining server-specific settings, and enhancing the Bot’s functionality based on usage patterns.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>Beatzbot does not permanently store any personal data or server-related information. Temporary logs are maintained only for the duration necessary to provide the music and queue services within each session.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Beatzbot does not share, sell, or disclose any collected data to third parties, except as required by law or to comply with legal processes.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected and maintain the security of our Bot. However, please note that no system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and continued use of Beatzbot after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the Bot’s data practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:ben@hartwick.me" style="color: #8e44ad;">ben@hartwick.me</a>.</p>
